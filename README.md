# Data-Structures-Project2019
This project contains our work for the end of the fall semester 2019 for the data structures class. 
This project helps users to identify the shortest way to travel from one airport to another and many other important things by using graphs.
In our work, we use Graphs, HashTables, and Lists extensively.

The project has some problems, as the airports and airline csv files do not seem to be the most up-to-date files.

The main function can be found in DesertFlood.java

Take note that extensive use has been made of the java graph library JGraphT.

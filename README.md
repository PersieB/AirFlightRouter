# AirFlightRouter
This project helps users to identify the shortest way to travel from one airport to another and many other important things by using graphs. It also helps users to find the busiest and most important airports i.e the airports with the highest number of departing and receiving flights.

In our work, we use Graphs, HashTables, and Lists extensively.

The project has some limitations, as the airports and airline csv files do not seem to be the most up-to-date files.

The main function can be found in DesertFlood.java

Take note that extensive use has been made of the java graph library JGraphT.
